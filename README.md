Hiyaaa!!! my name is Renze, and I'm originally from the Philippines.

I'm currently a second-year college student bachelor of science in information technology, where we learn fundamental concepts and several languages like Python.
In addition, I want to gain more programming knowledge so that I can become a programmer who can implement my ideas. I am aware that technology has grown significantly over time and is always changing. Because of this, we can never predict what will happen next. That is why this path I am taking make it challenging and wanna pursue this career.
